# Projects
These are a few projects I coded for 3000-level courses while studying at the University of Denver in 2019


## Movie Database Analysis:
Performed updates to an HBase movie database using Spark in a small distributed cluster. Read in csv files containing 20,000 movie entries from a Hadoop filesystem to create the database and then aggregated movie entries into per genre statistics. Coded in Java with reliance on Scalaâ€™s tuple library and Linux shell scripts to update and run remotely.  

## Process Scheduler
A round-robin multi-process scheduler built for any Operating System

## Stock Aggregation
Derive company fundamentals and perfom statistical aggregations on specific attributes with appropriate output
